I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Biomedical Sciences and Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/bmse/), [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/), my reseanch interest includes brain-computer interface, neuromodulation and cognitive neuroscience.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kai Wu](https://www.scholat.com/wukai) of [SCUT MINI(Medical Information and Neuroimaging) Lab](https://www.scholat.com/wukai). I'm currently an intern at [BrainCo Inc.](https://www.brainco.cn/), exploring the possibilities of ultrasound medicine.
