Entry for 8th National Biomedical Engineering Innovation Design Competition for College Students, advised by Prof. Kai Wu, Chenyang Gao and Wenhao Li. Calculated brain functional network features, heart rate variability features and heart-brain coupling features to build machine learning models for automatic diagnosis; Deep learning models using ResNet were built based on original EEG and ECG also. This work won the second prize in the finals.
