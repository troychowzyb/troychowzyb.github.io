Entry for $8^{th}$ National Biomedical Engineering Innovation Design Competition for College Students. Calculated brain functional network features, heart rate variability features and heart-brain coupling features to build machine learning models for automatic diagnosis; Deep learning models using ResNet were built based on original EEG and ECG also. This work won the second prize in the finals.
