excerpt: 'Propose a novel method for multi-dimensional mining of fMRI image information using an integrated model, uses 2D FC matrices based on gray matter maps and 3D T1 images as the input of the neural network, to do the discriminative analysis of schizophrenia patients.  Experiments have shown that our method achieved better performance beyond state-of-the-art methods.'
